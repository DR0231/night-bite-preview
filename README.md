# The Night Bite: preview copy

Test copy of nightbiteoh.com, served at https://dr0231.github.io/night-bite-preview/ . New features are built and checked here first, then copied to the live repo (DR0231/the-night-bite) once approved. Search engines are blocked (robots.txt plus a noindex meta on every page). The Whisperwood Vale game is not copied here; links go to the live game.

# The Night Bite

Static website: **Hoover Reservoir** fishing hub (Delaware / Franklin County, Ohio) — species pages, water/maps, trip log, tournaments, and gear kits. Cozy cabin-notebook look. Night fishing still a strength. Unofficial personal project — **not ODNR, not City of Columbus, not USGS**.

**Site name spelling:** *The Night Bite* (Night, not Nite).  
**Live domain:** `nightbiteoh.com` (CNAME in repo). Serve over **HTTPS** in production.

## Local preview

From this directory:

```bash
cd the-night-bite
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). A real HTTP server is required so `fetch()` can load `data/community-log.json` and `data/tournaments.json` (file:// will fail those).

Any static server works (`npx serve`, VS Code Live Server, etc.).

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Push this repo (GitHub Pages already used for `nightbiteoh.com`).
2. **Settings → Pages** → deploy from branch `main` / root (or your existing workflow).
3. Keep asset paths relative (`css/`, `js/`, `assets/`, `data/`).
4. Optional: `.nojekyll` at site root if Jekyll interferes.

**Do not commit secrets or PATs.** This site has no API keys. Mailto and the privacy page use the public contact `contact@nightbiteoh.com`.

## Adding a community trip

1. Prefer a GitHub issue via `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/trip-report.yml`, or use the Log page mailto / markdown helper.
2. After review, append an object to `data/community-log.json` → `trips` array:

```json
{
  "id": "community-YYYYMMDD-slug",
  "sample": false,
  "date": "2026-09-01",
  "species": "Channel catfish",
  "ramp": "Oxbow (upper ramp)",
  "time_window": "Night",
  "bait": "Cut shad",
  "keep_release": "Released",
  "notes": "Public-safe notes only."
}
```

3. Set `"sample": true` only for clearly marked demos.
4. Commit and deploy. No accounts required to read the list. Photos / logins = Phase 2.

## Adding a tournament

1. Use `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/tournament.yml` or the Tournaments mailto form.
2. Append to `data/tournaments.json` → `events`:

```json
{
  "lake": "hoover",
  "name": "Example club night",
  "date": "2026-10-01",
  "ramp": "Walnut Road (public)",
  "club": "Example club",
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "notes": "Third-party only."
}
```

`lake` is `hoover`, `alum` or `buckeye` (missing means `hoover`). Each lake view lists only its own events.

3. **Zero invented events.** Empty list is the honest default. This site is not a tournament director.

## SAMPLE private log entries

Log shows exactly one SAMPLE card. It normally comes from `data/community-log.json`; `js/log.js` (`SAMPLE_TRIPS`) only renders its copy when that JSON fails to load, and `log.html` has a noscript copy. SAMPLE demos are never stored. Storage key: `nightbite-log-v1` (user entries only).

## Water numbers

Home + Water show a **labeled provisional USGS snapshot** (pool param 62614, temp param 00010). `js/water.js` may refresh pool from the public IV JSON; **on failure it keeps the static snapshot and never invents**. Depth map: ODNR 2001 @ 894 ft — PDF linked, not for navigation. No Garmin/Navionics.
