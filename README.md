# The Night Bite: preview copy

Test copy of nightbiteoh.com, served at https://dr0231.github.io/night-bite-preview/ . New features are built and checked here first, then copied to the live repo (DR0231/the-night-bite) once approved. Search engines are blocked (robots.txt plus a noindex meta on every page). The Whisperwood Vale game is not copied here; links go to the live game.

# The Night Bite

Static website: **Hoover Reservoir** fishing hub (Delaware / Franklin County, Ohio) — species pages, water/maps, trip log, tournaments, and gear kits. Cozy cabin-notebook look. Night fishing still a strength. Unofficial personal project — **not ODNR, not City of Columbus, not USGS**.

**Site name spelling:** *The Night Bite* (Night, not Nite).  
**Live domain:** `nightbiteoh.com` (CNAME in repo). Serve over **HTTPS** in production.

## Local preview

From this directory:

```bash
cd the-night-bite
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). A real HTTP server is required so `fetch()` can load `data/community-log.json` and `data/tournaments.json` (file:// will fail those).

Any static server works (`npx serve`, VS Code Live Server, etc.).

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Push this repo (GitHub Pages already used for `nightbiteoh.com`).
2. **Settings → Pages** → deploy from branch `main` / root (or your existing workflow).
3. Keep asset paths relative (`css/`, `js/`, `assets/`, `data/`).
4. Optional: `.nojekyll` at site root if Jekyll interferes.

**Do not commit secrets or PATs.** This site has no API keys. Mailto and the privacy page use the public contact `contact@nightbiteoh.com`.

## Nav

## Adding a community trip

1. Prefer a GitHub issue via `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/trip-report.yml`, or use the Log page mailto / markdown helper.
2. After review, append an object to `data/community-log.json` → `trips` array:

```json
{
  "id": "community-YYYYMMDD-slug",
  "sample": false,
  "date": "2026-09-01",
  "species": "Channel catfish",
  "ramp": "Oxbow (upper ramp)",
  "time_window": "Night",
  "bait": "Cut shad",
  "keep_release": "Released",
  "notes": "Public-safe notes only."
}
```

3. Set `"sample": true` only for clearly marked demos.
4. Commit and deploy. No accounts required to read the list. Photos / logins = Phase 2.

## Adding a tournament

1. Use `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/tournament.yml` or the Tournaments mailto form.
2. Append to `data/tournaments.json` → `events`:

```json
{
  "lake": "hoover",
  "name": "Example club night",
  "date": "2026-10-01",
  "ramp": "Walnut Road (public)",
  "club": "Example club",
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "notes": "Third-party only."
}
```

`lake` is `hoover`, `alum` or `buckeye` (missing means `hoover`). Each lake view lists only its own events.

3. **Zero invented events.** Empty list is the honest default. This site is not a tournament director.

## SAMPLE private log entries

Log shows exactly one SAMPLE card. It normally comes from `data/community-log.json`; `js/log.js` (`SAMPLE_TRIPS`) only renders its copy when that JSON fails to load, and `log.html` has a noscript copy. SAMPLE demos are never stored. Storage key: `nightbite-log-v1` (user entries only).

## Water numbers

Home + Water show a **labeled provisional USGS snapshot** (pool param 62614, temp param 00010). `js/water.js` may refresh pool from the public IV JSON; **on failure it keeps the static snapshot and never invents**. Depth map: ODNR 2001 @ 894 ft — PDF linked, not for navigation. No Garmin/Navionics.

## Regs

## Lake home pages

Each lake has its own address: Hoover is the root (`/`), Alum Creek is `/alum/`, Buckeye Lake is `/buckeye/`.
`alum/index.html` and `buckeye/index.html` are generated, never edited by hand. After any change to `index.html`:

```bash
python3 tools/build-lake-pages.py && python3 tools/stamp-version.py
```

The generator adds `<base href="../">` (so every asset, script and fetch resolves from the root), the lake's
`nb-home` meta, its own title, description, canonical and OG tags (og:image is `assets/og/og-<lake>.png`), and points in-page links at the lake's page.
`js/lakes.js` reads `nb-home`. Old links still work: `/?lake=alum` and a saved lake choice (localStorage `nb-lake`)
send the root to `/alum/`. On Home the lake picker goes to the lake's address; on other pages it adds `?lake=`.
All three home pages are precached by `sw.js`, so each opens offline. List new lakes in `sitemap.xml` too.

## Home tools: Share tonight, Remind me

`js/tonight-tools.js` adds two buttons under the Right now strip.
A one line note under them ("Share tonight's wind, weather, sunset and what's biting") says what the card holds, so
Share doesn't read as sharing only the strip above. No live thumbnail: at thumbnail size the card's text is unreadable,
it would wait on the forecast, and it crowds the first screen.
Share tonight draws a 1200x630 PNG on the phone from what the page shows, angler info first: wind and gusts, air and
feels like, sky and rain chance (NWS), any NWS watch or warning (event name only), sunset, moonrise and moon (worked out
on the phone), water temp only where the lake has a public temp gauge (Hoover; Alum and Buckeye say "No public temp
gauge"), and the top 3 picks from the lake's "What's biting now" month notes. Lake level and the bite rating sit on one
small line. "--" when a value is missing. No URL and no source footer on the image; the sources are listed under it in
the dialog. Shares with the Web Share API with files where supported, or a download.
Remind me picks any time of day on a wheel (hour 1 to 12, minutes in 5 minute steps, AM/PM; scroll-snap columns with
spinbutton roles and arrow keys) or the Sunset button (exact minute). A time that already passed today rolls to tomorrow
and says so. No push server: a `.ics` calendar file (always works), and a phone notification that uses Notification
Triggers where the browser has them, otherwise a timer that only runs while the app is open.
`sw.js` handles `notificationclick` to open the lake's home page. Every URL comes from the page's own origin (`homeFor`,
the script URL), so the permission prompt names whatever site serves it.

## What's new (updates.html)

`updates.html` lists new features, improvements and fixes, newest first. Everything comes from one file, `data/updates.json`; `tools/build-updates.py` turns it into the page and the feed, so the page reads without JavaScript and search engines see it.

To add an update:

1. Add an entry at the top of `entries` in `data/updates.json` (below any draft):
   ```json
   {
     "id": "2026-11-02-short-name",
     "date": "2026-11-02",
     "tag": "New",
     "title": "Short title",
     "bullets": ["What changed, in plain words.", "Two to five bullets."],
     "links": [{ "label": "Home", "href": "./" }]
   }
   ```
   `tag` is `New`, `Improved` or `Fixed`. `id` must be unique; it becomes the entry's anchor (`updates.html#id`). Links are repo paths and must exist. Use the date the change went live (Eastern time), and only describe changes that actually shipped.
2. Run `python3 tools/build-updates.py && python3 tools/build-lake-pages.py && python3 tools/stamp-version.py`.
   The build checks the data (order, tags, 2 to 5 bullets, no spaced dashes, links exist) and stops with a message if something is off. It then:
   * prerenders the entries into `updates.html` between `<!-- updates:start -->` and `<!-- updates:end -->`;
   * writes the Atom feed `updates.xml` (dated entries only; linked from Home and updates.html with `<link rel="alternate">`);
   * stamps `data-updates="<newest date>"` on every What's new link in the nav, More menu and footer;
   * sets the `<lastmod>` for updates.html in `sitemap.xml`.
3. Bump `VERSION` in `sw.js` and deploy as usual.

**New dot.** `js/nav.js` compares the newest date on the links with `nb-updates-seen` in localStorage and shows a small amber dot on What's new (and on the More button on phones) until the visitor opens the page. Adding a dated entry turns the dot back on for everyone.

**Drafts.** An entry with `"draft": true` and `"date": null` is for features that are only on the preview. It shows on the preview (and localhost) with a dashed line and "Preview only", stays hidden on nightbiteoh.com (`js/updates-draft.js`), and never goes in the feed. When the feature ships, set its date, remove `"draft": true`, move it into date order and rebuild.

## Keep test runs out of the stats

The live site sends page views to Cloudflare Web Analytics (`static.cloudflareinsights.com`, `cloudflareinsights.com`).
Our own screenshot, CLS and test runs must never load it, or they show up as visitors (they did, as ChromeHeadless).

- **Every new script** blocks it in code. Node/Playwright: `const na = require("./tools/no-analytics.cjs");`, launch
  with `args: na.args()`, then `await na.block(context)`. Python: `from no_analytics import args, block` from
  `tools/no_analytics.py`, the same two steps (`await block(ctx)` with the async API).
- **The box blocks it for everything else**, including older scripts that were written before this: `/etc/hosts`
  maps both hosts to `0.0.0.0` and `::`, and a Chrome/Chromium policy (`/etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed/` and
  `/etc/chromium/policies/managed/nb-no-analytics.json`, `URLBlocklist`) refuses them.
- Check a run: no request to `cloudflareinsights.com` should succeed (the CLS and screenshot scripts print a count).
