# Service worker and Add to Home Screen (preview)

Files: `sw.js` (site root), `js/sw-update.js` (every page except whisperwood.html), `site.webmanifest`,
`offline.html`, `js/install-tip.js` (Home only), `assets/icons/icon-maskable-192.png` and `-512.png`.

## What it does

* Scope is the folder `sw.js` sits in: `/night-bite-preview/` on the preview, `/` on nightbiteoh.com. Every path in
  `sw.js` and the manifest is relative, so the same files work in both places.
* Precache (since v127, the "diet"): the shell only, 149 files, about 1.6 MB. The water picker (`./`), `hoover/`,
  `offline.html`, the manifest, favicons and icons, `css/styles.css`, the 44 shared scripts in `js/` (not the
  per lake `js/lake-map-data-*.js`), the Latin fonts, the picker tiles, Hoover's chart, map and depth contours, the
  map pins, moon and wind sprites, and `data/quick-facts.json`, `bait-shops.json`, `community-log.json` and
  `tournaments.json`. Up to v126 it was all 436 files (about 6.4 MB): every lake home, every page, all 18 language
  files and every lake's maps.
* Content hashes: `REVISIONS` in `sw.js` holds a 12 hex sha256 per precached file, written by
  `tools/sw-precache.py`. The precache (`PREFIX + "precache"`) is kept across deploys and each copy is saved under its
  hash, so a new worker downloads only the files whose hash changed. HTML hashes blank the `?v=` stamps first,
  because `stamp-version.py` rewrites them on every deploy without changing the page. A changed file is fetched with
  `cache: "no-cache"` (a 304 when the server copy is the same) and checked against its hash; if a cache in between
  still hands out last deploy's copy, it asks once more past it (`?nbrev=<hash>`, `cache: "reload"`) and keeps that.
  On the first install after v126 the worker also reuses any copy in the old per version cache whose hash matches,
  so that upgrade only downloaded `sw.js` and the newly precached `quick-facts.json`.
* Runtime caches, kept across deploys and capped by count (newest kept): `PREFIX + "pages"` (40) for every page
  opened online, so a lake you visited opens offline; `PREFIX + "data"` (60) for `data/*.json` and the language
  files; `PREFIX + "assets"` (200) for lake only scripts, lake maps and other images and fonts.
* Pages (navigations and `text/html`): network first with a 4 second timeout, then the saved copy (precache for
  `./` and `hoover/`, else the pages cache), then `offline.html`. An unvisited lake offline shows `offline.html`.
* `data/*.json`: network first, then the newest saved copy, then the precached one. The worker only answers the
  site's own pages; it never changes headers, so `data/advisor-rules.json` for the Android app (which fetches it
  directly over HTTPS) is exactly what GitHub Pages serves.
* CSS and JS: network first with the same 4 second timeout, saved copy when offline or slow. A precached script or
  style is not saved again at runtime: its offline copy is the one that matches the precached shell. (Through v11
  they were stale while revalidate, so right after a deploy a page could get new HTML with last deploy's
  `styles.css` and `hoover-map.js`: the lake picker showed unstyled and every map opened Hoover.)
* Fonts and images: precached ones come straight from the precache (they change only with their hash); the rest
  are stale while revalidate in the assets cache.
* Every page links its own CSS and JS with `?v=VERSION`, which skips GitHub Pages' 10 minute HTTP cache. The worker
  strips `?v=` (and any query) when it saves or looks up a copy, so offline copies still match.
* `js/sw-update.js` (renamed from `sw-register.js` in v12 so an older worker has never cached it) reloads the page
  once when a new worker takes over a page an older one was controlling, only in the first 20 seconds, and only if
  the old worker doesn't answer the `nb-hello` message with `assets: "network-first"` (v19 and newer do, v127
  included). There is no update toast; the update is silent.
* Activate deletes every other cache with this `PREFIX` (the old per version caches like `nb-preview-v126-...`
  included) and every precache entry that is no longer listed, then claims open pages. Other projects on the same
  origin (other github.io repos) are never cleared.

## Every deploy

1. Bump `VERSION` in `sw.js`.
2. Run `python3 tools/stamp-version.py` from the repo root. It rewrites every `?v=` to match (skips Whisperwood) and
   then runs `tools/sw-precache.py`, which refreshes `REVISIONS`. Run `sw-precache.py` again after any later build
   that touches a precached file; `tools/check-all.py` and `tools/promote.py` run it last on their own.
3. `python3 tools/sw-precache.py --check` (in the GitHub static checks and in check-all as `check-sw-precache`)
   fails when `REVISIONS` is stale or a precached file is missing (a missing file would fail every install).
* A precached file without a hash (say a line added by hand without running the tool) is keyed by `VERSION`
  instead, so it is downloaded again on every deploy, which is the old behaviour and never stale.
* To precache another file, add its path to `PRECACHE` and run `sw-precache.py`. Keep the list small: anything a
  visitor opens online is saved at runtime anyway. New lakes need no `sw.js` edit except the picker tile line that
  `build-tile-charts.py` writes.
* Never touched: anything under `whisperwood/` and `whisperwood.html` (no `respondWith`, nothing cached), the
  service worker file itself, any other origin (NWS, USGS, Google Maps, GitHub). Non GET requests pass through.
* Live readings are not cached by the service worker. The page keeps the last good USGS reading, 7 day trend and NWS
  forecast in localStorage (`nb-usgs-last`, `nb-trend-last`, `nb-cond-last`) and, with no signal, shows them with
  "Offline. Last updated HH:MM ET." Values only ever come from a real fetch.
* Measured on the v127 change (details in /workspace/nb-research/sw-diet-2026-11-11/): a deploy with one changed
  page moved 437 files and 6.44 MB to each installed phone before, and 2 files (`sw.js` and the page) and 63 KB after.

## Moving it to nightbiteoh.com

1. Copy `sw.js`, `js/sw-update.js`, `offline.html`, the maskable icons and the manifest changes. Keep `sw.js` at
   the repo root so the scope is `/`.
2. In `sw.js` set `PREFIX = "nb-live-"` and a fresh `VERSION`. Check the `PRECACHE` list against the live tree
   (clean URLs: the live site links `/water` style paths; `cachedPage()` already tries `.html` and `/` for
   extensionless paths, but precache the paths the live nav uses).
3. Whisperwood stays excluded by `isWhisperwood()`: it matches `whisperwood`, `whisperwood/...` and
   `whisperwood.html` relative to the scope. Don't add `sw-update.js` to any Whisperwood page. The game keeps
   its own saves in localStorage and is never served from this cache.
4. Change `worker-src 'none'` to `worker-src 'self'` in the CSP meta of the pages that load `sw-update.js`.
5. Manifest: drop "(Preview)" from `name`. Keep `id`, `start_url` and `scope` as `./`.
6. Every promotion bumps `VERSION` (promote.py does it) and runs `sw-precache.py` on the live tree last, so the
   hashes are those of the live files. Phones download only the files whose hash changed.

## Kill switch

If the worker ever misbehaves, deploy this as `sw.js` (same path). Browsers check for a new `sw.js` on every
navigation (at most every 24 hours), so it reaches everyone who opens the site:

```js
self.addEventListener("install", function () { self.skipWaiting(); });
self.addEventListener("activate", function (event) {
  event.waitUntil(
    caches.keys()
      .then(function (keys) { return Promise.all(keys.filter(function (k) { return k.indexOf("nb-") === 0; }).map(function (k) { return caches.delete(k); })); })
      .then(function () { return self.registration.unregister(); })
      .then(function () { return self.clients.matchAll({ type: "window" }); })
      .then(function (clients) { clients.forEach(function (c) { c.navigate(c.url); }); })
  );
});
```

The kill switch removes every cache whose name starts with `nb-`, which covers the v127 precache, pages, data
and assets caches too (tested on the v127 change). Also make `js/sw-update.js` stop registering (or replace its body with
`navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations().then(function (rs) { rs.forEach(function (r) { r.unregister(); }); });`).
Don't delete `sw.js` outright: a 404 leaves already installed workers running until they expire.
