## Tonight at Hoover card (js/conditions.js)
- Forecast: National Weather Service API, `https://api.weather.gov/points/40.11,-82.88` resolves to office ILN (Wilmington, OH), gridpoint 89,88. Hourly forecast: `https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/ILN/89,88/forecast/hourly`. Wind, air temp, rain chance (max of the next 12 hourly periods).
- Pressure trend: `https://api.weather.gov/stations/KCMH/observations`. KCMH (John Glenn Columbus International Airport, 39.99 N 82.88 W) is the first station NWS lists for gridpoint ILN 89,88 (`/gridpoints/ILN/89,88/stations`, next are KOSU and KDLZ). The card shows the change over the last 3 hours: the newest reading against the one closest to 3 hours earlier (used only when it is 2 to 4 hours older), from the same pressure field. Within 0.02 inHg is steady; 0.06 inHg or more in 3 hours counts as fast. Readings over an hour old get an "as of" time.
- Hourly strip: the hourly forecast periods from sunset (or from now, once the sun is down) through the period that starts at 2 AM ET. Hour, temperature, wind direction and speed, rain chance. Hidden if the hourly forecast can't be loaded.
- Storm heads up: thunder anywhere from now through 2 AM ET, from an hourly period whose `shortForecast` mentions thunder, or from the raw gridpoint `https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/ILN/89,88` (`weather` lists thunderstorms, or `probabilityOfThunder` is 25% or more). When the alert banner (js/alerts.js) is showing a thunderstorm or tornado Watch or Warning, the line points to it instead of repeating it.
- Feels like and dew point: from the same hourly period as the Air value, so they always agree. Wind chill (NWS formula) at 50 F or below with wind over 3 mph, heat index (NWS Rothfusz regression with its adjustments) at 80 F and up, otherwise the air temperature. Dew point is the period's `dewpoint`.
- Wind on the water: the bank the current hourly wind blows toward, the opposite of where it comes from (a southwest wind pushes into the northeast bank). Hoover runs north to south, so north and south winds name the south and north ends. Skipped under 3 mph.
- Tonight's bite (rule of thumb, not a forecast; also in the comment above biteRating in js/conditions.js):
  - Pressure, last 3 hours at KCMH: falling slowly (0.02 to 0.06 inHg) +2, steady +1, rising slowly 0, falling fast 0, rising fast -1.
  - Wind, average sustained NWS hourly speed over tonight's window: under 3 mph 0, 3 to 12 mph +1, 13 to 18 mph 0, over 18 mph -2.
  - Moon: new or full (the principal phase falls tonight, or under 10% or over 90% lit) +1.
  - Water temp from USGS 03228400 when the gauge sends one: 55 to 80 F +1, 45 to 54 or 81 to 86 F 0, colder or warmer -1. Water temp alone never makes a rating; pressure or wind must be known.
  - 4 or more is Good, 2 or 3 is Fair, 1 or less is Tough. Thunder in tonight's window always makes it Tough.
- Sunset, last light (end of civil twilight, Sun 6 degrees down), moonrise and moonset: computed in the browser (js/astro.js, port of SunCalc by Vladimir Agafonkin, BSD 2-Clause, with the Moon's position from the Meeus main terms and the standard parallax corrected rise and set altitude). Checked against the US Naval Observatory (aa.usno.navy.mil rstt/oneday) at 40.11 N 82.88 W for 2026-10-24, 10-25, 10-28, 11-02 and 11-10: sunset and last light within 2 minutes, moonrise and moonset within 2 minutes.
- Fallback when NWS can't be reached: "Weather unavailable, check weather.gov" with a link to the NWS point forecast.

## Alert banner (js/alerts.js, every page)
- `https://api.weather.gov/alerts/active?zone=OHC041,OHC049,OHZ046,OHZ055` (Delaware and Franklin County zones, plus their forecast zones from `/points`). Shown only for an active Warning or Watch.

## 7 day pool trend (js/pool-trend.js)
- USGS 03228400, Hoover Reservoir at Central College OH, parameter 62614 (lake elevation, ft NGVD29), `https://waterservices.usgs.gov/nwis/iv/?format=json&sites=03228400&parameterCd=62614&period=P7D`. Same gauge as js/usgs.js. Provisional.

## Map pins (js/hoover-map-data.js)
Map art: the same traced outline as assets/hoover-chart.png (trace of a Google Maps screenshot, web mercator, north up). The trace was georeferenced to the OpenStreetMap Hoover Reservoir polygon (relation 241088, IoU 0.89), and each pin is the real lat/lng projected through that fit. Ramps within 2.5 map pixels of the traced shore are snapped onto it; Oxbow sits in a cove the trace filled in, so it keeps its true position.

Pier net tip: the boardwalk card and the Gear page (catfish bank card and the bank packing list) suggest a pier net (bridge net) when fishing from the boardwalk or a bridge. That is gear advice, not a sourced fact.

The boardwalk pin is placed at the TrekOhio coordinate and snapped 1.6 to 1.9 map pixels onto the traced north shore.

Left out:
- "Lit at night" for every ramp: no source says either way.
- Restrooms at Oxbow, Sunbury Road, Red Bank and Walnut: not confirmed for those exact sites (an OpenStreetMap pit toilet near Sunbury Rd is about 0.5 mile from the ramp, so it wasn't used).
- Shop hours: listings disagree (Old Dutchman shows 6 or 7 a.m. opening depending on the source).
- Cheshire Market (5094 Cheshire Rd, Galena, live bait): real, but it is by Alum Creek, off this map.
- Canoe and kayak only launches on the city map (sites "B" and "E") and the Hoover Dam marina: not boat ramps, so not pinned yet.

These are typical seasonal patterns, not a fishing report. Winter months add a line to check ice and cold water safety.
