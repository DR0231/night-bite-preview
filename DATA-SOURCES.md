# Data sources (preview features)

Updated 2026-10-24 (ET): Tonight at Hoover gets the hourly strip, Tonight's bite, last light and moonset, 3 hour pressure change, storm heads up, feels like and dew point, and wind on the water.

Updated 2026-10-22 (ET): boardwalk added; What's biting now added.

Checked 2026-10-22 (ET). Only details confirmed by a source below are shown on the site. Anything missing was left out on purpose.

## Tonight at Hoover card (js/conditions.js)
- Forecast: National Weather Service API, `https://api.weather.gov/points/40.11,-82.88` resolves to office ILN (Wilmington, OH), gridpoint 89,88. Hourly forecast: `https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/ILN/89,88/forecast/hourly`. Wind, air temp, rain chance (max of the next 12 hourly periods).
- Pressure trend: `https://api.weather.gov/stations/KCMH/observations`. KCMH (John Glenn Columbus International Airport, 39.99 N 82.88 W) is the first station NWS lists for gridpoint ILN 89,88 (`/gridpoints/ILN/89,88/stations`, next are KOSU and KDLZ). The card shows the change over the last 3 hours: the newest reading against the one closest to 3 hours earlier (used only when it is 2 to 4 hours older), from the same pressure field. Within 0.02 inHg is steady; 0.06 inHg or more in 3 hours counts as fast. Readings over an hour old get an "as of" time.
- Hourly strip: the hourly forecast periods from sunset (or from now, once the sun is down) through the period that starts at 2 AM ET. Hour, temperature, wind direction and speed, rain chance. Hidden if the hourly forecast can't be loaded.
- Storm heads up: thunder anywhere from now through 2 AM ET, from an hourly period whose `shortForecast` mentions thunder, or from the raw gridpoint `https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/ILN/89,88` (`weather` lists thunderstorms, or `probabilityOfThunder` is 25% or more). When the alert banner (js/alerts.js) is showing a thunderstorm or tornado Watch or Warning, the line points to it instead of repeating it.
- Feels like and dew point: from the same hourly period as the Air value, so they always agree. Wind chill (NWS formula) at 50 F or below with wind over 3 mph, heat index (NWS Rothfusz regression with its adjustments) at 80 F and up, otherwise the air temperature. Dew point is the period's `dewpoint`.
- Wind on the water: the bank the current hourly wind blows toward, the opposite of where it comes from (a southwest wind pushes into the northeast bank). Hoover runs north to south, so north and south winds name the south and north ends. Skipped under 3 mph.
- Tonight's bite (rule of thumb, not a forecast; also in the comment above biteRating in js/conditions.js):
  - Pressure, last 3 hours at KCMH: falling slowly (0.02 to 0.06 inHg) +2, steady +1, rising slowly 0, falling fast 0, rising fast -1.
  - Wind, average sustained NWS hourly speed over tonight's window: under 3 mph 0, 3 to 12 mph +1, 13 to 18 mph 0, over 18 mph -2.
  - Moon: new or full (the principal phase falls tonight, or under 10% or over 90% lit) +1.
  - Water temp from USGS 03228400 when the gauge sends one: 55 to 80 F +1, 45 to 54 or 81 to 86 F 0, colder or warmer -1. Water temp alone never makes a rating; pressure or wind must be known.
  - 4 or more is Good, 2 or 3 is Fair, 1 or less is Tough. Thunder in tonight's window always makes it Tough.
- Sunset, last light (end of civil twilight, Sun 6 degrees down), moonrise and moonset: computed in the browser (js/astro.js, port of SunCalc by Vladimir Agafonkin, BSD 2-Clause, with the Moon's position from the Meeus main terms and the standard parallax corrected rise and set altitude). Checked against the US Naval Observatory (aa.usno.navy.mil rstt/oneday) at 40.11 N 82.88 W for 2026-10-24, 10-25, 10-28, 11-02 and 11-10: sunset and last light within 2 minutes, moonrise and moonset within 2 minutes.
- Fallback when NWS can't be reached: "Weather unavailable, check weather.gov" with a link to the NWS point forecast.

## Alert banner (js/alerts.js, every page)
- `https://api.weather.gov/alerts/active?zone=OHC041,OHC049,OHZ046,OHZ055` (Delaware and Franklin County zones, plus their forecast zones from `/points`). Shown only for an active Warning or Watch.

## 7 day pool trend (js/pool-trend.js)
- USGS 03228400, Hoover Reservoir at Central College OH, parameter 62614 (lake elevation, ft NGVD29), `https://api.waterdata.usgs.gov/ogcapi/v1/collections/continuous/items?f=json&monitoring_location_id=USGS-03228400&parameter_code=62614&time=P7D&skipGeometry=true&properties=time,value&limit=5000`, fallback `https://waterservices.usgs.gov/nwis/iv/?format=json&sites=03228400&parameterCd=62614&period=P7D`. Same gauge as js/usgs.js. Provisional.

## USGS Water Data APIs (js/lakes.js: usgsLatest, usgsSeries), switched Oct. 27, 2026
- Every USGS read (Tonight card, Right now strip, lake picker, pool trend) goes through js/lakes.js. First try: the new USGS Water Data OGC API, `https://api.waterdata.usgs.gov/ogcapi/v1/collections/latest-continuous/items` (latest values) and `.../continuous/items` (7 day series), 8 second timeout, no API key (rate limited per IP by api.data.gov).
- Fallback: the legacy WaterServices IV API (`waterservices.usgs.gov/nwis/iv`). USGS adds a 2 second delay to it from Nov. 16, 2026 and turns it off Feb. 22, 2027 (https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/wdfn-waterservices-degradation/). Remove the fallback and its CSP host then.
- If both fail: the saved offline reading, then "unavailable, check USGS".
- Parity check, Oct. 27, 2026: Hoover 62614 890.60 ft and 00010 18.0 C, Buckeye 62614 891.45 ft, same in both APIs; 7 day series had the same point counts (Hoover 167, Buckeye 667).
- `window.NightBiteUsgsVia` shows which API answered last ("ogcapi" or "waterservices").

## Map pins (js/hoover-map-data.js)
Map art: the same traced outline as assets/hoover-chart.png (trace of a Google Maps screenshot, web mercator, north up). The trace was georeferenced to the OpenStreetMap Hoover Reservoir polygon (relation 241088, IoU 0.89), and each pin is the real lat/lng projected through that fit. Ramps within 2.5 map pixels of the traced shore are snapped onto it; Oxbow sits in a cove the trace filled in, so it keeps its true position.

Pier net tip: the boardwalk card and the Gear page (catfish bank card and the bank packing list) suggest a pier net (bridge net) when fishing from the boardwalk or a bridge. That is gear advice, not a sourced fact.

The boardwalk pin is placed at the TrekOhio coordinate and snapped 1.6 to 1.9 map pixels onto the traced north shore.

Left out:
- "Lit at night" for every ramp: no source says either way.
- Restrooms at Oxbow, Sunbury Road, Red Bank and Walnut: not confirmed for those exact sites (an OpenStreetMap pit toilet near Sunbury Rd is about 0.5 mile from the ramp, so it wasn't used).
- Shop hours: listings disagree (Old Dutchman shows 6 or 7 a.m. opening depending on the source).
- Cheshire Market (5094 Cheshire Rd, Galena, live bait): real, but it is by Alum Creek, off this map.
- Canoe and kayak only launches on the city map (sites "B" and "E") and the Hoover Dam marina: not boat ramps, so not pinned yet.

These are typical seasonal patterns, not a fishing report. Winter months add a line to check ice and cold water safety.

## Lakes: Alum Creek Lake and Buckeye Lake (preview)

Hoover stays the default. The active lake comes from `?lake=hoover|alum|buckeye`, then localStorage `nb-lake`, then Hoover. Per lake settings live in `js/lakes.js`. Readings, saved snapshots and caches for other lakes use their own storage keys (`-alum`, `-buckeye` suffix), so they never mix with Hoover.

| Setting | Alum Creek Lake | Buckeye Lake |

Typical patterns, not a fishing report.

Gaps (said on the site, never filled in):
- No public water temperature for either lake.
- Alum Creek's lake level is the Corps of Engineers reading, not USGS; values are provisional.
- Ramp lighting, restrooms and shop hours are not shown unless a source says so.
- No community trips logged at either lake yet; the sample trip is Hoover's.
- Structure notes for these lakes are reference notes, not first-hand nights.

Regulations (2026–27, ODNR Fishing Regulations PDF above): the 30 crappie, 9″ minimum site rule lists Delaware, Indian and O'Shaughnessy, not Griggs, so Griggs crappie follow the statewide pattern (no daily limit, no minimum). Hybrid, striped and white bass are statewide: 30 combined, no more than 4 over 15″. Walleye, sauger and saugeye: 6 combined, no minimum at any of the four.

Hybrid stocking at O'Shaughnessy and Griggs: ODNR Fishing Tips, Hybrid Striped Bass (https://ohiodnr.gov/discover-and-learn/education-training/wild-ohio-harvest-community/fishing-tips): "the Division stocks hybrids in Buckeye, Charles Mill, Dillon, East Fork, Griggs, Kiser and O'Shaughnessy". The site does not list hybrids at Buckeye Lake (pre-existing; see open questions in the build notes).

Stocking & surveys (stocking.html): Indian Lake and Delaware Lake use the same ODNR District lake PDFs as Hoover and Alum Creek (Indian saugeye stocking; Indian saugeye, crappie and largemouth bass growth; Delaware crappie and largemouth bass growth; channel catfish surveys linked; Indian 2014 and Delaware 2016 angler surveys). ODNR posts no stocking table for Delaware Lake, and no lake PDFs for O'Shaughnessy or Griggs; those blocks say so and link the ODNR fishing area page and the hybrid stocking line above.

Dock season (data/docks.json): City of Columbus Marinas and Docks (O'Shaughnessy and Griggs marina docks May 1 to Oct. 31, 614-645-3337), Facility Alerts (Trabue-Murphy ramp at Griggs closed), Griggs Park and O'Shaughnessy Reservoir park pages; ODNR Indian Lake State Park (office 937-843-2717) and Delaware State Park (office 740-363-4561) pages; ODNR Winter Drawdowns (Delaware 5 ft, Oct. 1 to Nov. 1, 2025, refill Mar. 1 to Apr. 1, 2026, start postponed by the Corps to after Dec. 1, 2025 for drought; no Indian Lake row). All are in the `watch` list for `tools/check-docks.py`.

Gaps (said on the site, never filled in):
- No public water temperature at O'Shaughnessy or Delaware Lake.
- Delaware Lake's level is the Corps of Engineers reading, not USGS; values are provisional.
- No ODNR species survey for O'Shaughnessy or Griggs, so only hybrid striped bass are listed there.
- No 2026 dock pull or drawdown dates posted for these four on Oct. 29, 2026.
- No community trips logged at these lakes yet.

## Lake-aware Species (js/species-lake.js)

No new data. Which species live at each lake: `data-lakes` on each card (same lists as `js/lakes.js`). Biting now:
the current month's picks from `js/biting-data.js` / `js/biting-data-lakes.js`. Ramps and access: the lake's map data
places of type ramp or access, shown with their own source labels.

## Share card (js/tonight-tools.js)

No new data. The card copies the Right now strip (USGS or USACE gauge with its "Checked" time; bite rule of thumb
from the NWS forecast with its "Checked" time) and prints "--" for anything missing. Static per-lake OG images
(`assets/og/og-<lake>.png` for every lake but Hoover) are the site art with the lake's name, no live data.

## Dock season (water.html#docks), checked Oct. 28, 2026

Built from `data/docks.json` by `tools/build-docks.py` (then `tools/stamp-version.py`). `js/docks.js` flips an
"ending" line to its after text once the date passes in Columbus, and flags a check older than 14 days. No fetches.

- No 2026 dock pull dates are posted for any of the three on Oct. 28, 2026.
- Watching: `python3 tools/check-docks.py` reads every page in the `watch` list of `data/docks.json` and compares
  the dock, ramp, closure and drawdown sentences with `tools/docks-watch-state.json`. Last line `RESULT: CHANGED n`
  means read the +/- lines and the page, update `data/docks.json` (and `checked`), rebuild, then rerun with
  `--update` and commit the new baseline. ODNR and Columbus also post on Facebook; those are not watched.

## Ice season (ice.html), checked Oct. 27, 2026

- ODNR Ice Fishing Safety: https://ohiodnr.gov/discover-and-learn/safety-conservation/recreational-safety/ice-fishing-safety

## Offline and Add to Home Screen

No new data. The service worker (`sw.js`) caches this site's own files only; live NWS, USGS and Corps of Engineers requests are never cached by it. The last good live readings are kept in the browser (localStorage) and shown offline with "Offline. Last updated HH:MM ET". Details and the plan for the live site are in SERVICE-WORKER.md.

## Stocking & surveys (stocking.html), checked Oct. 27, 2026
- ODNR District 1 lake PDFs, `https://ohiodnr.gov/static/documents/wildlife/fishing-forecasts-reports/d1/lakes/<Lake> <Species> Stocking|Survey up20.pdf` and the Angler Survey PDFs. Data through 2019; files last modified Mar. 15, 2024 on ODNR's server. Values copied by hand from the PDF tables and checked against the rendered PDF.
- Hoover: saugeye, blue catfish and walleye stocking; saugeye, crappie and largemouth bass length at age with ODNR's statewide average; 2016 angler survey. Alum Creek: saugeye and muskellunge stocking; the same three growth tables; 2018 angler survey.
- Not copied: catch rate bar charts (images only, linked); channel catfish growth tables (ages don't line up cleanly, linked).
- Forecast bullets: summarized from the Fishing Forecast on each ODNR fishing area page (hoover-reservoir-fishing-area, alum-creek-lake-fishing-area). Undated by ODNR.
- Buckeye Lake: ODNR's fishing area page posts no stocking, survey or forecast data. Lake facts (built about 1830, about 2,873 acres, average about 6 ft, max about 14 ft) are from that page.
- Newer stocking (2020 on): ODNR Fish Stocking Database on DataOhio, https://ohiodnr.gov/buy-and-apply/hunting-fishing-boating/fishing-resources/fish-stocking-records . Linked, not copied.
- Habitat map: links to ODNR's Interactive Ohio Lake Fishing Map (ArcGIS Experience, deep link per lake) and ODNR's lake depth map PDFs (dam.assets.ohio.gov .../wildlife/maps/hooverreservoir2.pdf, alumcreeklake2.pdf, buckeyelake2.pdf). Nothing hosted or traced; reuse terms for the GIS service were not found.
- Built by tools/build-stocking.py (values live in the script). Edit there, run it, then tools/stamp-version.py.

## Lake rules, water quality and Buckeye facts (preview, Phase 2)

Checked Oct. 27, 2026. Copied only from the agency that runs each lake; nothing is paraphrased into a new rule.

- Hoover boating rules (water.html#rules): Columbus City Code 921.01 (https://library.municode.com/oh/columbus/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TIT9STPAPUPRCO_CH921WARE): 10 hp, 8 to 22 ft (sail to 25 ft), 10 mph, idle within 100 ft of shore, motors over 10 hp tilted or prop removed, no water skiing, no boating within 100 ft downriver of the dam; 921.01-1(F) bans personal watercraft. Columbus Rec and Parks Hoover page (https://columbusrecparks.com/parks/hoover-reservoir-parkland/) lists 9.9 hp max, no wakeboarding, tubing or swimming in any City reservoir.
- Alum Creek: ODNR Alum Creek Lake Fishing Area page: unlimited horsepower, portions of the lake are no wake zones.
- Buckeye Lake: ODNR Buckeye Lake Fishing Area page: no horsepower restrictions; built about 1830, about 6 ft average and 14 ft max depth, relatively flat bottom with little woody cover. 2,873 acres and the 300 ft no wake zone are from the ODNR fishing map (buckeyelake2.pdf).
- Fishing seasons and limits are not copied. The "Check official regs" button links ODNR's Ohio Fishing Regulations PDF.
- Water quality (water.html#water-quality): links only, to ODH BeachGuard (https://publicapps.odh.ohio.gov/beachguardpublic/) and Ohio EPA harmful algal blooms (https://epa.ohio.gov/monitor-pollution/pollution-issues/harmful-algae-blooms). No advisory status is fetched or shown.
- Species stocking lines (tools/build-species-stocking-lines.py): one line on saugeye, blue catfish, walleye, muskellunge, black and white crappie, largemouth bass and channel catfish pages, copied from the same ODNR PDFs as /stocking, linking to it for that lake. None on Buckeye, which has no ODNR tables.

## Tonight, in short and Local notes (preview, Phase 3)

- "Tonight, in short" (home Tonight card, js/conditions.js renderLine) restates numbers already on the page in one line: sunset (or "after dark now"), tonight's NWS hourly wind range and top rain chance from sunset to 2 AM, storms if the storm line found any, the KCMH 3 hour pressure trend, the gauge water temp when there is one, and the pool card's "below full pool" figure and 7 day trend word. No score, no prediction; it hides when none of those are loaded. The separate "Tonight's bite" rule of thumb line is unchanged.
- Local notes (water.html#notes) holds the owner's own notes. It ships with placeholder slots marked "Sample note, replace with your own" and no content. See LOCAL-NOTES.md.
- ODNR fishing map layers (DOW_LakeFishing MapServer) are not embedded: the service publishes no copyright, description or reuse terms, so the site stays link only. The legacy USGS waterservices fallback stays in place.
