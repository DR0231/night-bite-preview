# Data sources (preview features)

Updated 2026-10-22 (ET): boardwalk added; What's biting now added.

Checked 2026-10-22 (ET). Only details confirmed by a source below are shown on the site. Anything missing was left out on purpose.

## Tonight at Hoover card (js/conditions.js)
- Forecast: National Weather Service API, `https://api.weather.gov/points/40.11,-82.88` resolves to office ILN (Wilmington, OH), gridpoint 89,88. Hourly forecast: `https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/ILN/89,88/forecast/hourly`. Wind, air temp, rain chance (max of the next 12 hourly periods).
- Pressure trend: `https://api.weather.gov/stations/KCMH/observations`. KCMH (John Glenn Columbus International Airport, 39.99 N 82.88 W) is the first station NWS lists for gridpoint ILN 89,88 (`/gridpoints/ILN/89,88/stations`, next are KOSU and KDLZ). Trend compares the newest barometric pressure with the reading closest to 12 hours earlier: rising or falling when the change is 1 hPa (about 0.03 inHg) or more, otherwise steady.
- Sunset and moonrise: computed in the browser (js/astro.js, port of SunCalc by Vladimir Agafonkin, BSD 2-Clause). Checked against the US Naval Observatory for 2026-10-22 and 23 at 40.11 N 82.88 W: sunset within 2 minutes, moonrise within 4 minutes.
- Fallback when NWS can't be reached: "Weather unavailable, check weather.gov" with a link to the NWS point forecast.

## Alert banner (js/alerts.js, every page)
- `https://api.weather.gov/alerts/active?zone=OHC041,OHC049,OHZ046,OHZ055` (Delaware and Franklin County zones, plus their forecast zones from `/points`). Shown only for an active Warning or Watch.

## 7 day pool trend (js/pool-trend.js)
- USGS 03228400, Hoover Reservoir at Central College OH, parameter 62614 (lake elevation, ft NGVD29), `https://waterservices.usgs.gov/nwis/iv/?format=json&sites=03228400&parameterCd=62614&period=P7D`. Same gauge as js/usgs.js. Provisional.

## Map pins (js/hoover-map-data.js)
Map art: the same traced outline as assets/hoover-chart.png (trace of a Google Maps screenshot, web mercator, north up). The trace was georeferenced to the OpenStreetMap Hoover Reservoir polygon (relation 241088, IoU 0.89), and each pin is the real lat/lng projected through that fit. Ramps within 2.5 map pixels of the traced shore are snapped onto it; Oxbow sits in a cove the trace filled in, so it keeps its true position.

Pier net tip: the boardwalk card and the Gear page (catfish bank card and the bank packing list) suggest a pier net (bridge net) when fishing from the boardwalk or a bridge. That is gear advice, not a sourced fact.

The boardwalk pin is placed at the TrekOhio coordinate and snapped 1.6 to 1.9 map pixels onto the traced north shore.

Left out:
- "Lit at night" for every ramp: no source says either way.
- Restrooms at Oxbow, Sunbury Road, Red Bank and Walnut: not confirmed for those exact sites (an OpenStreetMap pit toilet near Sunbury Rd is about 0.5 mile from the ramp, so it wasn't used).
- Shop hours: listings disagree (Old Dutchman shows 6 or 7 a.m. opening depending on the source).
- Cheshire Market (5094 Cheshire Rd, Galena, live bait): real, but it is by Alum Creek, off this map.
- Canoe and kayak only launches on the city map (sites "B" and "E") and the Hoover Dam marina: not boat ramps, so not pinned yet.

## What's biting now (Species page)

| Feature | What it shows | Sources |
|---|---|---|
| What's biting now card (`js/biting-data.js`, `js/biting.js`) | The current month (device clock, America/New_York) and the 2 or 3 best bets at Hoover, each with typical depth or spot and time of day or night, linked to the species page. Catfish first from May to October nights. Static data, works with no network. "Changes each month." | The Night Bite species pages (Season, Time of day, Where on Hoover sections) ; ODNR Hoover Reservoir Fishing Area forecast, https://ohiodnr.gov/go-and-do/plan-a-visit/find-a-property/hoover-reservoir-fishing-area (three catfish species, white bass spring run up Big Walnut Creek and schools on shad) ; ODNR news May 29, 2025, "Central Ohio is a Fishing Destination for Saugeye, Crappie, Bass, and Catfish", https://ohiodnr.gov/wps/portal/gov/odnr/discover-and-learn/safety-conservation/about-ODNR/news/central-ohio-is-a-fishing-destination-for-saugeye-crappie-bass-catfish (crappie on point edges near deep water after May, 1/16 oz jigs; catfish on the north end with cut bait spring through summer) ; ODNR central Ohio release as reprinted by Madison SWCD, Apr 26, 2022, https://www.madisonsoilandwater.com/news-events/newsroom2.html/article/2022/04/26/central-ohio-offers-fantastic-saugeye-and-crappie-fishing (best catfishing north of Sunbury Road, cut shad) and Lancaster Eagle-Gazette, Jun 13, 2024 (crappie to shore cover to spawn) ; ODNR Hoover fishing map (894 ft contours), https://dam.assets.ohio.gov/image/upload/ohiodnr.gov/documents/wildlife/maps/hooverreservoir2.pdf ; Columbus Rec and Parks, Hoover Reservoir Parkland, https://columbusrecparks.com/parks/hoover-reservoir-parkland/ ; seasonal depth ranges for channel catfish and crappie from A and A Fishing's Hoover report (Rick Seaman, updated July 13, 2026), https://www.aa-fishing.com/oh/hoover-reservoir-fishing-report.html, used as typical ranges only |

These are typical seasonal patterns, not a fishing report. Winter months add a line to check ice and cold water safety.
